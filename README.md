# CPSC6420_Artificial_Intelligence

* Project 1
In this project we had to implement a number of search algorithms to guide an agent through a grid-based world. The search alogrithms were Depth First Search (DFS),
Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A*.

* Markov Decision Process and Q-Learning (Project 2)
In this project we had to implement three classic algorithms for solving Markov Decision Processes: value iteration, policy iteration, and (tabular) Q-learning. We had to test these algorithms in simple grid-like worlds, and also had the opportunity to use Q-learning to control the crawler bot.

Value Iteration:
