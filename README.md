# CPSC6420_Artificial_Intelligence

* Project 1
In this project we had to implement a number of search algorithms to guide an agent through a grid-based world. The search alogrithms were Depth First Search (DFS),
Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and A*.

* Markov Decision Process and Q-Learning (Project 2)
In this project we had to implement three classic algorithms for solving Markov Decision Processes: value iteration, policy iteration, and (tabular) Q-learning. We had to test these algorithms in simple grid-like worlds, and also had the opportunity to use Q-learning to control the crawler bot.

Value Iteration:

* Adversarial Games (Connect 4):
In this assignment we had to design agents for the zero-sum game Connect Four, in which two players take turns dropping a colored disc from the top into a 7x6 grid. The game is won by forming a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four same colored discs. We had to apply Minimax, Alpha-beta pruning and Expectimax to the game.

Minimax:
